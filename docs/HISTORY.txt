borg.localrole - 2.0.1

    - Renamed the default adapter to "default" so that people don't 
      accidentally override it with an unnamed adapter. Overriding the default
      should be possible, but is a marginal use case. If it's overridden but
      not replicated properly, all sorts of problems can result.

borg.localrole - 2.0.0 Released April 20th, 2008

    - Baseline for Plone 3.1
